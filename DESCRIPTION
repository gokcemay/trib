Description: Tribology test devices such as pin-on-disk, ball-on-disk machines and profilometers give important data for tribological analysis. trib is built to analyze and visualize that data into human understandable form. It has functions for finding coefficient of friction, Friction Force vs Distance graphs and calculating Wear Track Volume and Wear Track plotting.
